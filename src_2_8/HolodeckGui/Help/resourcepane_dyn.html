  Holodeck can also track external file, library, and registry resources and log 
  every read, write, update, or access the application makes. The resource pane 
  shows al these resources in an easy to read tree view.<br>

  Jump to the last log entry that touched a resource by right clicking the resource 
  in the resource pane and selecting &#8220;Select most recent log entry&#8221;<br>
  <br>
  You can set a resource fault easily by finding the resource 
  in the treeview right clicking and selecting the desired fault.<br>
  <br>
  Check which files and Registry entries your program touches, reads, writes, 
  or modifies in the Resource Pane.<br>
  <br>
  Look in the property pane to see how many times a resource was touched and what 
  the last API call was that used this resource.<br>
<br>
Resources will not be tracked if logging for these categories is turned off. </font>  </p>
