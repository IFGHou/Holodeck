  The process node represents a process under test such as the main application, 
  an added application or a new process the main application spawned. Its children 
  represent all the information that Holodeck is tracking for this process. If 
  you want to see all the threads running in this process turn the Per Thread 
  option on from the Application menu. <br>

  Holodeck can also test multiple applications simultaneously by clicking <strong>File 
    -&gt; New Test Application</strong>. This will open the <strong>New Test Application</strong> 
  window.<br>
  <br>
  If you want to clear all tests, limits and faults at the same time you can select 
  the process node and press the delete key</font></p>
