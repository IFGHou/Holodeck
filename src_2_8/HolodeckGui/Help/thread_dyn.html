  The Thread node is a container; it holds all the information for that thread, 
  including logs, faults, tests, and exceptions.Holodeck will automatically track 
  any new threads that are created by the process you are testing. If Holodeck 
  is in Per-Thread mode each new thread will show up in the Project Pane as a 
  child of its parent process.<br>

  Turn on Per-Thread Logging by clicking <strong>Application -&gt; Per-Thread</strong> 
  on the Menubar. <br>
  <br>
  Double clicking an active log node in the Project Pane will open a log pane 
  that will show just entries for the thread you chose.</font></p>
