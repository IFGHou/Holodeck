  You can create a Recorded Session while testing your application by using the 
  Record Session Functionality. This will allow you to reproduce a test or bug 
  more precisely than trying to remember and write down steps. Recorded Sessions 
  are global to your entire project, so they will record changes to all of the 
  process and threads being tested by Holodeck. Recorded Sessions record all changes 
  made to Holodeck, it is up to a test harness to record changes made to the application.
