Holodeck
========


Comprehensive Simulation and Tuning for Fragility & Security Testing
--------------------

Holodeck is a unique test tool that uses fault injection to simulate real-world application and system errors for Windows applications and services. Testers and Developers work in a controlled, repeatable environment to analyze and debug error-handling code and application attack surface – it’s ideal for adept testers doing application fragility and security testing.

Holodeck is the first commercially available fault-simulation tool and was developed by leading researchers in the application quality field.  It is used by organizations like Microsoft, Adobe, Symantec, EMC and McAfee to ensure the products delivered to their customers are of the highest quality.

Unprecedented Control
----------------------

Faulty error-handling code is a major contributor of reliability, security, and functional defects - and typically goes uncovered by conventional testing methods.   Holodeck's point-and-click environment simulation provides powerful and comprehensive reliability and error handling testing without disrupting the rest of your system. Because you have complete control over all Windows, .Net,  and API calls that your application makes, you can trick your application into thinking that it is out of memory, network bandwidth is maxed out, or that a registry file or key it needs is corrupt. Holodeck can be used as a stand-alone tool or in conjunction with Automated Test Tools or IDE's such as VisualStudio.

Holodeck provides testers and developers with the following benefits:

 - Safe fault injection and environment simulation
 - Comprehensive reporting
 - Application insight via detailed application monitoring
 - API integration with automated testing tools
 - Built-in debugger for fast problem solving
 - Automated scheduled and random test generation
 - more features and benefits
