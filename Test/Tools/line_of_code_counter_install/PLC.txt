1. Abstract
-----------
Project Line Counter is an add-in for both Microsoft Visual C++ and Visual 
Studio .NET.  Line Counter reports statistics about files in your projects, 
including: number of lines, lines with code, lines with comments, mixed 
lines (code and comments), and more.  


2. What's New?
--------------
A full version history can be found in the online help file.  You can open
this file by selecting Help|Contents from the Line Counter menu.
You can also view the version history at:
http://www.wndtabs.com/plc/plc_ver.asp.



3. System Requirements
----------------------
Line Counter requires one of the following host development environments:
	o Microsoft Visual C++ version 5 (DevStudio '97)
	o Microsoft Visual C++ version 6 (DevStudio 6)
	o Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2002
	o Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003
Line Counter has been tested under Windows 2000 and XP, but under Visual C++
5/6 it *should* work will all OSes going back to Windows 95.


4. Installation
---------------
Starting with v2.10, Project Line Counter comes with a fully automatic 
installer/uninstaller.  To install, run the installer and follow the 
instructions.  You can uninstall Project Line Counter from Add/Remove 
Programs Control Panel.


5. The Workspace Whiz! Interface
--------------------------------
Under Visual C++ 5/6, Line Counter requires the freely available Workspace
Whiz! Interface library.  This library allows Line Counter to extract 
project file information which would otherwise not be available to it.
Generally, you should install the version of the Interface that ships with
Line Counter (the automatic installer will take care of this for you).  
However, newer versions of the interface (as they become available) will 
probably be compatible as well.
For more information, see the online help, or http://www.workspacewhiz.com.

NOTE: The Workspace Whiz! Interface is not required under Visual Studio.NET.
