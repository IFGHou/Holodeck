HOLODECK STRESS TESTER FRAMEWORK AND AUTOMATION UTILITY

Description:

Provides automation and generation of stress testing reports. The tool runs various applications
monitoring aspects of performance and resource utilization. Automation is used to continually
keep the applications under test active. Logging threads monitor those applications, and after
execution completes, Excel spreadsheets are generated with charts graphing the statistical
results.


Requirements:

	- Microsoft Office 2003 - Word and Excel
	- Microsoft Visual Studio.NET Office Tools 2003 (Word and Excel assemblies)

Additional Information:

Included in this version is a copy of QuakeII.NET. This application is used to intercept a 
graphical .NET app. It is included in order that separate steps do not need to be taken
to get the stress tester to run on the target machine.
